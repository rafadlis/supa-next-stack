# UI Development Guidelines

## Component Library and Styling

### Primary Components
- The project uses `shadcn` as the primary component library
- All base `shadcn` components are located in the `@/components/ui` Before creating new components, check the existing ones in `@/components/ui`

### Styling Hierarchy
1. First priority: Use styles from `globals.css`
2. Second priority: Use `tailwindcss` utility classes
3. For enhanced UI components: Reference designs from `orginui.com`

## Layout and Spacing Guidelines

### Visual Hierarchy
- Maintain consistent spacing throughout the application
- Follow the proximity principle: Related components should be placed closer together
- Use spacing to indicate relationships between elements:
  - Closer spacing = Stronger relationship
  - Wider spacing = Weaker relationship

## Best Practices
- Always check `@/components/ui` before adding new shadcn components
- Leverage existing styles from `globals.css` before creating new ones
- Use `tailwindcss` for custom styling when global styles don't meet needs
- Reference `orginui.com` for refined UI patterns and component variations
